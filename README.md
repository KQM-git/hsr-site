# KQM HSR Site
AIM: Modern look (compete w/ others), passes accessibility standards, mobile-friendly, editor-friendly processes.

## TODO: Home Page 
    Thoughts on assets:
		- Check Fontawesome or other SVG sites for socials icons
		- Standardize image sizes
		- Get other KQM logos
		- If there's an official color-scheme, get ahold of it
		- Look at other style guides and yoink if open-source

	Current thoughts for components: 
		- Header - have astro auto-generate breadcrumbs
    		- Field for custom background images
		- Footer - should be easy to find template
		- Background - fixed. Find script (i have one sitting somewhere but need to find it)
		- Event Component
		- 'Groups' like 'What's New' group
		- Edit 'Card' component. Add tags, etc. Create an example
		  in MDX that showcases following:
		  	- Title, Custom slug, tags, date (auto generate?)
		  	- Any sort of auto-generated table (like Tibo mentioned)
		  	- Links to other guides. SRL link. Outside link.
    	- Search component

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
├── public/
│   └── favicon.svg
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── Card.astro
│   ├── layouts/
│   │   └── Layout.astro
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
