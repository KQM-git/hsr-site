# KQM:HSR Site

## Routing (aka what's up with src/pages)
*.astro, *.md, *.mdx in src/pages will just lead to the specified page (static routing). I.e. `~/src/pages/about.astro` becomes `hsr.keqingmains.com/about`

Astro has a system for dynamic routing. Here' s Astro's documentation about it is [here](https://docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/routing/#dynamic-routes).

Important note:
